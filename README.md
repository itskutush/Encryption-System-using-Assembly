# Encryption System using Assembly Language

The "8086 Assembly Monoalphabetic Substitution Encryption System" is a fascinating exploration 
of the convergence of low-level programming and the realm of cryptography. This project delves 
into the intricate world of encryption, employing 8086 assembly language to implement a 
monoalphabetic substitution cipher—a fundamental encryption technique. The endeavor is 
designed to serve as an educational endeavor and a practical exercise, offering enthusiasts and 
aspiring programmers a unique opportunity to understand the inner workings of encryption at the 
machine code level.



## Software and Hardware Requirements
• x86 emulator emu8086: EMU8086 is a popular and user-friendly integrated development 
environment and emulator for the x86 architecture assembly language.

• Intel 8086 Assembly Language: Intel 8086 assembly language is a low-level programming 
language used for programming the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 microprocessors.

## Approach
There are many methods for encrypting data. The monoalphabetic cipher is among the easiest techniques. A monoalphabetic cipher is a substitution cipher in which an alternate alphabetic letter is used for each letter in the plain text. It makes use of a fixed key made up of the 26 characters in a "shuffled alphabet".
This application uses this technique to encrypt and decrypt a character string.
1. Both uppercase and lowercase characters are handled by the application.
2. The result of this program is devoid of any spaces.
